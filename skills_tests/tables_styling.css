/* tables */

/* Here are the most important points for tables and css 

Make your table markup as simple as possible, and keep things flexible, e.g. by using percentages, so the design is more responsive.
    
Use table-layout: fixed to create a more predictable table layout that allows you to easily set column widths by setting width on their headings (<th>).

Use border-collapse: collapse to make table elements borders collapse into each other, producing a neater and easier to control look.

Use <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> to break up your table into logical chunks and provide extra places to apply CSS to, so it is easier to layer styles on top of one another if required.

Use zebra striping to make alternative rows easier to read.

Use text-align to line up your <th> and <td> text, to make things neater and easier to follow.

/* spacing */
/*A table-layout value of fixed is generally a good idea 
to set on your table, as it makes the table behave a bit 
more predictably by default. */

/*With table-layout: fixed, you can size 
your columns according to the width of their headings, */

/*The entire column width follows the width of its heading, 
making for a nice way to size your table columns.*/

/*A width of 100% means the table will fill any container it
is put in and be responsive although it would still need some
more styling work to look good.*/

/*A border-collapse value of collapse is standard best 
practice for any table styling effort. By default, when 
you set borders on table elements, they will all have 
spacing between them, which does not look very nice */
