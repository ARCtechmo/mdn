				A common use of max-width is to cause images to scale down if there is
				not enough space to display them at their intrinsic width while making
				sure they don't become larger than that width.

			<div class="min">
				In addition to giving things a fixed size, we can ask CSS to give an
				element a minimum or a maximum size. If you have a box that might
				contain a variable amount of content, and you always want it to be at
				least a certain height, you could set the min-height property on it.
